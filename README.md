# simple-encrypter
This is a simple CLI file encrypter decrypter written in c++.
It doesn't use (yet) any system commands so it should work in 
any OS.
## Usage:
- compile separately `enc.cpp` and `dec.cpp`
- enc encrypts files, while dec decrypts them.
  when called any of those two, write in standard input the key, and
  the name of the file to encrypt/decrypt.
